\begin{frame}{Introduction}
The early diagnosis of diabetes is crucial for avoiding major risks associated with the disorder. This research proposes a machine learning pipeline for predicting the onset of diabetes with high accuracy.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Dataset}
The research uses a novel diabetes dataset that is gender-neutral and representative, unlike the well-known PID dataset.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Machine Learning Pipeline}
The machine learning pipeline involves:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Multiple feature engineering pipelines
    \item Feature selection using ANOVA filter and Crow Search Optimization algorithm
    \item Feature extraction using Singular Value Decomposition
    \item Classification using heterogeneous classifiers like Naive Bayes', Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and GradientBoost
    \item Stacking ensemble of classifiers
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Performance Evaluation}
Performance evaluation is done through Repeated Stratified K-fold Cross Validation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 Score, and area under Receiver Operating Characteristic curve.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Results}
The highest accuracy achieved is 98.4 percent with the Crow Search algorithm through a stacking ensemble of multiple heterogeneous classifiers. Comparative analysis with a recent related work on the same dataset shows improved accuracy using a reduced feature set.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
The proposed machine learning pipeline shows promising results for early diagnosis of diabetes, outperforming existing methods on the same dataset.
